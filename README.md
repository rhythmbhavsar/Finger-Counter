# Introduction
Python has libraries that will help us develop our project. We will need OpenCv and MediaPipe. We will later look at why and how we will use these two libraries.

## **OpenCV**

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. 
OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.
